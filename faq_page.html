                <!-- FAQ 4 -->
                <details class="faq-card bg-white p-6 rounded-xl shadow-md">
                    <summary class="text-lg font-bold text-primary">How does Inno4Def differ from regular Defence projects?</summary>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2 border-t pt-4">Inno4Def focuses on short-cycle and bottom-up innovation. This means the process is faster and ideas originate from those facing the operational challenges daily, unlike long-term, top-down procurement programs.</p>
                </details>

                <!-- FAQ 5 -->
                <details class="faq-card bg-white p-6 rounded-xl shadow-md">
                    <summary class="text-lg font-bold text-primary">How does the Innovation Board work?</summary>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2 border-t pt-4">The Innovation Board is the decision-making body composed of Innovation Officers from all Defence components, general directorates and staff departments.

                    <summary class="text-lg font-bold text-primary">What is the typical timeframe for an Inno4Def project?</summary>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2 border-t pt-4">Inno4Def focuses on short-cycle innovation. The time from idea submission to implementation is generally much faster than traditional procurement, aiming for rapid testing and scaling where possible, often measured in weeks and months rather than years.</p>
                </details>

                <!-- FAQ 7 -->
                <details class="faq-card bg-white p-6 rounded-xl shadow-md">
                    <summary class="text-lg font-bold text-primary">What support do I get if my idea is approved?</summary>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2 border-t pt-4">Approved ideas move into the execution phase where you receive coaching from the Innovation Board Officers. Projects are supported through dedicated resources like the Physical/Digital Sandbox for testing and development. It is possible that there is additional support from the IaaS-contract (Innovation as a Service) partners: Verhaert, HackBelgium and Sopra Steria.</p>

                <details class="faq-card bg-white p-6 rounded-xl shadow-md">
                    <summary class="text-lg font-bold text-primary">How does Innovation4Defence fit in the overall innovation and R&D ecosystem in Belgium?</summary>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2 border-t pt-4">Inno4Def acts as the internal accelerator for Defence's specific operational needs. While traditional R&D often focuses on long-term technological development, Inno4Def focuses on rapid, short-cycle solutions driven by the user. By opening our Challenges to external partners, we actively collaborate with the Belgian ecosystem (academia, research centers, and industry) to pull proven civilian and military technologies into practical Defence application, thereby strengthening the technological base of the Defence-Nation link.</p>

                <!-- FAQ 15 -->
                <details class="faq-card bg-white p-6 rounded-xl shadow-md">
                    <summary class="text-lg font-bold text-primary">What is a good idea? what are the sucess factors?</summary>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2 border-t pt-4">A successful Inno4Def idea addresses a genuine, validated operational need and has a clear potential for impact, even if it starts small. Success factors include: 1. Clarity and Focus (Is the problem clearly defined?), 2. Feasibility (Can it be tested and developed relatively quickly?), and 3. Scalability (Does it have the potential for broader Defence application?). The most important factor is often the Innovator's commitment to coaching and testing.</p>
